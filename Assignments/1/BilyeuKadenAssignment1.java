 *  Name: Kaden Bilyeu
 *  Class: CS1150 Section 2

 *  Description: Assignment #1 
 *  This program demonstrates that I probably understand basic program structure by 
 *  printing a couple paragraphs that tell the instructor what Iâ€™m passionate       
 *  about.  It also gives a little practice with arithmetic in Java.
